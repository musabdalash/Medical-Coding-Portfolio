# Crohn's Disease Coding Project

#### In this project, we'll focus on coding Crohn's disease cases using the ICD-10-CM system. Our goal is to accurately assign codes for various conditions related to Crohn's disease, considering both simple and complex scenarios.



#### Project Overview:
In this project, we'll focus on coding Crohn's disease cases using the ICD-10-CM system. Our goal is to accurately assign codes for various conditions related to Crohn's disease, considering both simple and complex scenarios.

#### Project Structure:

1. **`codes` Folder**:
   - This folder will store ICD-10 codes related to Crohn's disease. Each code will be documented with its description and rationale.
   - Example:
     - `codes/K50.00.md`: Crohn's disease of the small intestine without complications
     - `codes/K50.90.md`: Crohn's disease, unspecified site (for complex cases)

2. **`case_studies` Folder**:
   - Here, we'll include sample medical cases for coding practice. Each case study will provide patient information, symptoms, diagnostic findings, and relevant documentation.
   - Example:
     - `case_studies/Case1.md`: Emily Johnson (complex Crohn's disease case)
     - `case_studies/Case2.md`: John Doe (simple Crohn's disease case)

3. **`documentation` Folder**:
   - In this folder, we'll explain our approach, coding rationale, and any challenges faced during the coding process.
   - Example:
     - `documentation/Approach.md`: Describes our overall coding methodology
     - `documentation/Rationale.md`: Explains why specific codes were chosen
     - `documentation/Challenges.md`: Discusses any difficulties encountered

#### Sample Files:

1. **`codes/K50.00.md`**:
   - **Description**: Crohn's disease of the small intestine without complications
   - **Rationale**: Since the specific location is not mentioned, we use the unspecified code.

2. **`case_studies/Case1.md`** (Complex Case: Emily Johnson):
   - **Patient Information**: Emily Johnson, 42 years old
   - **Medical History**: Crohn's disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, anemia, depression
   - **Presenting Symptoms**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss
   - **Diagnostic Findings**: Active inflammation in the terminal ileum and cecum
   - **ICD-10 Codes Assigned**:
     - K50.90 (Crohn's disease, unspecified site)
     - I10 (Hypertension)
     - E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)
     - M81.0 (Postmenopausal osteoporosis with pathological fracture)
     - D50.9 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified)
     - F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)

3. **`documentation/Approach.md`**:
   - Describes our step-by-step approach to coding Crohn's disease cases.
   - Includes considerations for sequencing codes and handling complex scenarios.
