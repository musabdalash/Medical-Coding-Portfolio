# Crohn's Disease Coding Project


### Project Overview:
In this project, I'll focus on coding Crohn's disease case using the ICD-10-CM system. My goal is to accurately assign codes for various conditions related to Crohn's disease, considering both simple and complex scenarios.


#### Case Study:
   - **Patient Information**: Emily Johnson, 42 years old
   - **Medical History**: Crohn's disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, anemia, depression
   - **Presenting Symptoms**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss
   - **Diagnostic Findings**: Active inflammation in the terminal ileum and cecum
   
#### ICD-10 Codes Assigned:
- `K50.90` (Crohn's disease, unspecified site)
- `I10` (Hypertension)
- `E11.9` (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)
- `M81.0` (Postmenopausal osteoporosis with pathological fracture)
- `D50.9` (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified)
- `F32.9` (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)


# Comprehensive Medical Coding Case Study


#### Case Study:
**Patient Information:** Sarah Adam, 55 years, 
- **Name**: Sarah Adams
- **Age**: 55 years
- **Medical History**:
  - **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**: Diagnosed 10 years ago; currently managed with oral medications.
  - **Hypertension**: Controlled with antihypertensive medication.
  - **Osteoarthritis**: Chronic pain in both knees.
  - **Obesity**: BMI of 35.
  - **Depression**: Currently on antidepressant therapy.

**Presenting Symptoms:**
   **Chief Complaint**:
    - Sarah presents to her primary care physician with complaints of:
    - Increased knee pain and stiffness
    - Difficulty managing blood sugar levels
    - Persistent feelings of sadness and low energy

**Diagnostic Findings**
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Bilateral knee tenderness and crepitus
  - Elevated blood pressure
  - Depressed affect


#### Documentation and Rationale
**Principle Diagnosis**
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**:
  - Code: `E11.9`
  - Rationale: Sarah's history of diabetes requires ongoing management. Type 2 DM without complications.

**Additional Diagnoses:**
1. **Hypertension**:
   - Code: `I10`
   - Rationale: Controlled hypertension is part of Sarah's medical history. Primary hypertension.

2. **Osteoarthritis**:
   - Code: `M17.9`		
   - Rationale: Chronic knee pain and stiffness warrant this diagnosis. Unspecified laterality.

3. **Obesity**:
   - Code: `E66.9`
   - Rationale: Sarah's BMI indicates obesity. Unspecified.

4. **Depression**:
   - Code: `F32.9`
   - Rationale: Sarah's persistent feelings of sadness and low energy require attention. Major depressive disorder single episode, unspecified.

#### Sequencing Rules
- Sequence the codes based on the reason for the encounter.
- Consider the impact of each condition on Sarah's health.
